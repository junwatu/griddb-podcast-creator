![cover](images/cover.jpg)

## Introduction

Podcasts have become a favorite way for people to learn and consume content while going about their daily activities. Whether you're commuting, exercising, or doing household chores, podcasts let you learn hands-free.

Key benefits of podcast learning:
- Listen while doing other tasks
- Learn at your own pace
- Perfect for busy professionals
- More engaging than reading long documents
- Great for auditory learners

However, converting existing PDF documents into podcasts can be time-consuming and complex. That's where AI-powered solution comes in - it will transform PDFs into clear, natural-sounding podcasts.

## Problems with Converting PDFs to Podcasts Manually

Turning PDFs into practical, engaging podcasts manually presents several challenges that affect productivity and listener experience:

### Slow and Tedious Text Extraction

- Manual copy-pasting from PDFs is time-consuming, especially with large or complicated documents.

- PDFs often contain complex structures (tables, columns, charts), causing extraction errors.

- Correcting errors after manual extraction adds extra workflow overhead.

### Difficulties in Simplifying Complex PDF Content

- Dense, technical PDF documents require careful manual summarization to become understandable for broader audiences.

- Manually rewriting complex ideas into simple language is labor-intensive, context-dependent, and prone to inconsistencies.

- Without automated summarization, maintaining a consistent tone and ensuring clarity for listeners becomes challenging.

### Issues in Managing and Storing PDF Content

- Storing large volumes of PDFs manually quickly becomes unmanageable.
Difficulties arise in tracking versions, accessing historical files, and efficiently retrieving information.
- Without structured storage, repurposing or updating previous podcast episodes becomes inefficient and time-consuming.
- Leveraging an AI-powered podcast solution effectively addresses these challenges by quickly converting PDFs into simplified, listener-friendly audio content—greatly improving productivity and audience engagement.

## Building the Podcast Generator Step-by-Step

### Developing the Next.js Web Interface & API

- Describe Next.js frontend UI pages for uploading PDFs and display generated podcasts.
- Show file upload components and preview components.

Code snippet example to create Next.js API route:

```javascript
// Next.js API route example
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function POST(req) {
  const data = await req.formData();
  const file = data.get('pdfFile');

  if (!file) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'No PDF file uploaded' }, { status: 400 });
  }

  // Call OCR API and Database storage (handled in next sections)

  return NextResponse.json({ message: 'PDF Uploaded Successfully' });
}
```

### Integrating OCR using Mistral AI

Mistral OCR is an Optical Character Recognition API that sets a new standard in document understanding. Unlike other models, Mistral OCR comprehends each element of documents—media, text, tables, equations—with unprecedented accuracy and cognition. It takes images and PDFs as input and extracts content in an ordered interleaved text and images.

In this project, we will use Mistral OCR to extract text from PDFs. The process involves:

1. Uploading the PDF file to Mistral.

```javascript
const uploaded_pdf = await this.client.files.upload({
    file: {
        fileName: fileName,
        content: file,
    },
    purpose: "ocr"
});
```

2. Retrieving the signed URL for the uploaded PDF.

```javascript
const signedUrl = await this.client.files.getSignedUrl({
    fileId: uploaded_pdf.id,
});
```

3. Sending the signed URL to Mistral OCR for text extraction.

```javascript
const ocrResponse = await this.client.ocr.process({
    model: "mistral-ocr-latest",
    document: {
        type: "document_url",
        documentUrl: signedUrl.url,
    }
});
```

### Get PDF Keypoints and Summarization

We won't convert all the content of the PDF extraction text because it will be to long. The best way is to summarize and get the key points od the extraction data. For this task, we will use `gpt-4o` model.

This is the system prompt to extract meaningfull data from PDF's extracted data:

```txt
Create a 5-minute podcast episode script in a conversational style, using the content provided.\n\nInclude the following elements:\n\n- **Introduction**: Engage your audience with an intriguing opening statement related to the topic. Capture their attention immediately.\n\n- **Main Talking Points**: Develop 3-4 main sections discussing the central ideas or arguments. Use relatable examples and personal stories for better understanding. Maintain a conversational tone, as if you are speaking directly to the listener. Ensure natural transitions between sections to keep the flow.\n\n- **Conclusion**: Summarize the key takeaways in a concise manner, making sure to leave a lasting impression.\n\n- **Call to Action**: End with a clear and compelling call to action encouraging listeners to engage further or reflect on the topic.\n\n# Output Format\n\nWrite the script in a conversational and engaging narrative suitable for a podcast. Each section should integrate seamlessly with transitions, emulate a direct speaking style to engage the listener, and reinforce the message.\n\n# Examples\n\n**Introduction**: \"Welcome to [Podcast Name]. Today, we're diving into [Topic]. Have you ever wondered...?\"\n\n**Main Talking Points**:\n\n1. \"Let's start with [Main Idea]. It's like when...\"\n2. \"Moving on to [Next Idea], consider how...\"\n3. \"Finally, when we talk about [Final Idea], there's a story about...\"\n\n**Conclusion**: \"So, as we've learned today, [Key Takeaway 1], [Key Takeaway 2]...\"\n\n**Call to Action**: \"Think about how you can [Action]. Join us next time when we explore...\"\n\n# Notes\n\n- The script should be written to cater both to novices and those with some prior knowledge.\n- Ensure it resonates intellectually and stimulates curiosity among listeners.\n- Use transition words to guide listeners smoothly from one idea to the next.
```

To keep the response consistent, we can use schema feature. So, basically, we can force the AI model response to match predefined data structure or schema:


```json
{
  "introduction": "Welcome to our podcast! Today, we're exploring how AI can revolutionize the way we consume content by transforming PDFs into engaging audio podcasts. Have you ever wished you could listen to your documents instead of reading them? Let's dive in!",
  "main_talking_points": [
    {
      "title": "The Challenges of Manual PDF-to-Podcast Conversion",
      "content": "Manually converting PDFs into podcasts is a tedious process. It involves extracting text, summarizing complex content, and recording audio—all of which take significant time and effort. AI simplifies this by automating these steps, saving you hours of work."
    },
    {
      "title": "How AI Simplifies the Process",
      "content": "AI tools like Mistral OCR and OpenAI TTS streamline the workflow. Mistral OCR extracts text from PDFs with high accuracy, while OpenAI's models summarize and convert the text into natural-sounding audio. This ensures a seamless and efficient process."
    },
    {
      "title": "The Role of GridDB in Managing Data",
      "content": "GridDB Cloud acts as a robust storage solution for parsed text and audio files. It ensures that your data is organized, easily retrievable, and ready for future use, making the entire system scalable and efficient."
    }
  ],
  "conclusion": "In summary, AI-powered tools are transforming the way we interact with content. By automating the conversion of PDFs into podcasts, we save time, enhance accessibility, and create a more engaging learning experience.",
  "call_to_action": "Think about how you can leverage this technology in your own projects. Visit our GitHub repository to get started, and don't forget to share your feedback!"
}
```

The `gpt-4o` will response data with these keys:

- `introduction`
- `main_talking_points`
- `conclusion`
- `call_to_action`

With these format then it will be easier to convert the text to audio for out podcast application.

### Generating Podcast using OpenAI TTS

We will use the `gpt-4o-mini-tts` model from OpenAI to generate speech from text. This model capable to control the voice of your generated audio with additional [instructions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/createSpeech#audio-createspeech-instructions).

We will process the audio in two process based on the schema response from the OpenAI model.

1. Process `introduction`, `conclusion`, and `call_to_action`.

This code will process introduction, conclusion, and call to action into audio.

```javascript
  const simpleKeys = ['introduction', 'conclusion', 'call_to_action'] as const;

  for (const key of simpleKeys) {
    try {
      const text = podcastData[key];
      const fileName = `${key}.${outputFormat}`;
      const speechFile = path.join(outputDir, fileName);

      const response = await openai.audio.speech.create({
        model,
        voice,
        instructions,
        input: text
      });

      const buffer = Buffer.from(await response.arrayBuffer());
      fs.writeFileSync(speechFile, buffer);

      audioFiles[key] = speechFile;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Error processing ${key}:`, error);
      throw error;
    }
  }

```

2. Process `main_talking_points`

This code will process the main content or talking points into audio.

```javascript

  // Process main talking points separately
  if (Array.isArray(podcastData.main_talking_points)) {
    for (let i = 0; i < podcastData.main_talking_points.length; i++) {
      try {
        const point = podcastData.main_talking_points[i];
        const text = point.content;
        const fileName = `talking_point_${i}.${outputFormat}`;
        const speechFile = path.join(outputDir, fileName);

        const response = await openai.audio.speech.create({
          model,
          voice,
          instructions,
          input: text
        });

        const buffer = Buffer.from(await response.arrayBuffer());
        fs.writeFileSync(speechFile, buffer);

        audioFiles[`talking_point_${i}`] = speechFile;
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error processing talking point ${i}:`, error);
        throw error;
      }
    }
```

### Storing Data to GridDB Cloud

The column data for the GridDB database is simple:

```ts
export interface GridDBData {
	id: string | number;
	ocrResponse: Blob;
	audioScript: string;
	audioFiles: string;
}
```

Then to saving data to the GridDB, in this project the code is in `insertData` function:

```javascript
async function insertData({
  data,
  containerName = 'podcasts',
}: {
  data: GridDBData;
  containerName?: string;
}): Promise<GridDBResponse> {
  console.log(data);
  try {
    const row = [
      parseInt(data.id.toString(), 10),
      data.ocrResponse,
      data.audioScript,
      data.audioFiles,
    ];

    const path = `/containers/${containerName}/rows`;
    return await makeRequest(path, [row], 'PUT');
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof GridDBError) {
      throw error;
    }
    const errorMessage = error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error';
    throw new GridDBError(`Failed to insert data: ${errorMessage}`, undefined, undefined, error);
  }
}
```

The core code actually just PUT operation on REST route path `/containers/podcasts/rows`. It's so easy to use GridDB on the cloud.
